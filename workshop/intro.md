There are a ton of great resources for learning about Raspberry Pis for education, but the best place to start is the [Raspberry Pi Learning Resources](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/). These pages cover all the introductory material, links to community pages, and several simple and well-organized lessons. Here are some of the ones we suggest you look at to get started:

* [What is a Raspberry Pi?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/)
* [A Teachers' Guide to Using Raspberry Pi in the Classroom](https://www.raspberrypi.org/guides/teachers/)
* [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Lesson](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-lesson/)
