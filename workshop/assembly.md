# Assembly

The order of these steps isn't critical, but don't plug in the power (micro USB cables).

* Insert a microSD card into each Raspberry Pi.
* Connect a monitor to each Raspberry Pi using an HDMI-to-DVI cable.
* Connect the two Raspberry Pis with the Ethernet cable.
* Connect the USB keyboard and mouse to the first Raspberry Pi you want to configure.
